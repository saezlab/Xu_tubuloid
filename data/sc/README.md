# Single-cell and single-nuclei processed data

Here it is located the processed data: filtered feature-barcode for each sample.
This data is the main input for the data analysis. They are the UMI counts matrices, gene by cells, from each sample.

## Samples

This is a summary of samples included:

### Kidney adult tissue

* ADPKD3 : human specimen with ADPKD (ND genotype).
* CK224_PT25_PKD2- : human specimen with ADPKD (PKD2- genotype).
* CK225_PT8_PKD1- : human specimen with ADPKD (PKD1- genotype).
* Control1 : human specimen with healthy tissue.
* Control2 : human specimen with healthy tissue.

### Organoids

* JX1_HC_organoid : late organoid (Healthy). Organoid generated following Hans Clever's protocol for kidney organoids.
* JX2_PKD1KO_organoid : PKD1-KO organoid (PKD). Organoid generated from CD24+ sorted cells from human adult kidney tissue, for which PKD1 was gene-edited to reproduce PKD phenotype, developed at a late stage.
* JX3_PKD2KO_organoid : PKD2-KO organoid (PKD). Organoid generated from CD24+ sorted cells from human adult kidney tissue, for which PKD2 was gene-edited to reproduce PKD phenotype, developed at a late stage.
* Organoid : early stage organoid (Healthy). Organoid generated from CD24+ sorted cells from human adult kidney tissue at an early stage.
* CK119_organoid : late stage organoid (Healthy). Organoid generated from CD24+ sorted cells from human adult kidney tissue at a late stage.

### Sorted kidney cells

* CK120_CD13 : CD13+ sorted cells from human adult kidney tissue.
* CK121_CD24 : CD24+ sorted cells from human adult kidney tissue.
